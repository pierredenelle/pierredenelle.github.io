## R packages

R packages provide ready-to-use toolkits for the scientific community. Here is a list of R packages I have authored or contributed to:

| Name                                        | CRAN version                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                          |

## Shiny applications

Shiny applications are interactive web applications that can, among other things, improve the visualization of results or provide a nice interface to practice specific knowledge.  
Below is a list of Shiny applications I have authored:

1\. Trait-environment relationships in grassland plants.  
<https://shiny.cefe.cnrs.fr/trait_environment_relationships/>  
Associated publication: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12623" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1111/geb.12623-008fffff.svg"/></a>   

2\. Bioregionalization of French vegetation.  
<https://shiny.umr-tetis.fr/CarHab/>  
Associated publication (in French) [here](https://hal-lara.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-04269906/).  

3\. Application to test and train botanical knowledge.  
<https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/shiny/BotanizeR/>  
Associated publication: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10226" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-110.1002/ppp3.10226-008fffff.svg"/></a>   

4\. Conservation priorities across New Guinea.

Associated article in revision.

The following Shiny application is related to the study of Lirong Cai, in which I am a co-author. It also allows to download the raster and shapefile of the predicted plant richness on a global scale.
