Welcome to this site! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, in the [Biodiversity, Macroecology and Biogeography](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/128741.html) team.

My research focuses on community assembly, functional ecology, and biogeography/macroecology. Through these disciplines, I seek to understand what governs the presence of species in a given environment, taking into account biotic and abiotic constraints at different scales. To address these issues, I draw in particular on the theoretical and methodological contributions of functional ecology.
Although most of this work focuses on vascular plants, I am always interested in and curious about applying the concepts and methods to other taxa.

As of March 2025, I have participated in 30 peer-reviewed publications that address these questions. You can find all these publications in the dedicated section.

Below is an interactive visualization of my coauthorship network[^1], with a total of 158 coauthors, which I hope will continue to grow and expand.

[^1]: To create this graph, I first extracted information from my publications using the R package [scholar](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scholar). Then I used the R package [visNetwork](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=visNetwork). The following [page](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/project/creating-co-author-networks-in-r/) was also helpful for inspiration.
