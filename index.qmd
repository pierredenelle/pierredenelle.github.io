I am Postdoctoral researcher at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, in the [Biodiversity, Macroecology and Biogeography](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/128741.html) team.

My research addresses fundamental questions at the interface of community ecology, macroecology, and functional ecology. I aim to understand and predict the effects of the environment on patterns of biodiversity. I address these questions by combining large databases of species distributions, functional traits, phylogenetic characters, and environmental information with statistical modeling to unravel patterns of diversity across scales. Most of this work focuses on vascular plants.

*Key words*

Biogeography, community ecology, functional ecology, macroecology, plant diversity
